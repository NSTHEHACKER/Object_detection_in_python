# Image Resizer

This Python script can be used to resize images in a directory to a specified target size. The resized images are saved to a specified output directory.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. Install the required packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

1. Set the directory containing the images by changing the `image_directory` variable in the script. 
2. Set the target size for resizing by changing the `target_size` variable in the script.
3. Set the directory to store resized images by changing the `output_directory` variable in the script. 
4. Run the script using the command `python resize_images.py`.
5. Check the output directory for the resized images.

Note: The script only resizes images with the file extensions ".jpg" and ".png". If you have images with other file extensions, modify the script accordingly.
